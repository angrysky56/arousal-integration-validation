## Phase 1: Baseline Implementation (NEXT)

**Status**: Ready to begin
**Priority**: P0 - Required for all comparisons

### Components to Build

#### 1. Base Agent Class (2 hours)
**File**: `src/agents/base.py`

**Purpose**: Abstract interface for all agents

**Key Methods**:
```python
class BaseAgent(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def select_action(self, state: GridState, epsilon: float) -> Action
    
    @abstractmethod
    def update(self, transition: Transition) -> None
    
    @abstractmethod
    def reset_episode(self) -> None
    
    def get_q_table(self) -> dict[tuple, dict[Action, float]]
    def get_metrics(self) -> dict[str, float]
```

**Design Notes**:
- Common interface for all three architectures
- Metric collection standardized
- Q-table inspection for debugging

#### 2. Architecture A: Monolithic PVT (4 hours)
**File**: `src/agents/monolithic.py`

**Purpose**: Baseline with global arousal modulation

**Key Features**:
```python
class MonolithicPVTAgent(BaseAgent):
    def __init__(
        self,
        state_space_size: int,
        action_space_size: int,
        learning_rate: float,
        discount_factor: float,
        arousal_config: dict,
    ):
        self.q_table: dict[tuple, dict[Action, float]]
        self.arousal_monitor: ArousalMonitor
        
    def _compute_state_key(self, state: GridState) -> tuple:
        # Combine all state info into single key
        return (state.agent_pos, state.goal_pos, 
                state.npc_pos, state.npc_mood_estimate)
```

**Arousal Sources**:
- Navigation errors (wall collisions, inefficient moves)
- Interaction outcomes (hostile/friendly surprises)
- Time pressure (steps remaining)

#### 3. Training Infrastructure (2 hours)
**File**: `experiments/run_baseline.py`

**Purpose**: Hyperparameter search and baseline establishment

**Key Functions**:
```python
def train_agent(
    agent: BaseAgent,
    env: SimpleSocialGridWorld,
    n_episodes: int,
    seed: int,
) -> dict[str, Any]:
    """Train agent and collect metrics."""
    
def hyperparameter_search(
    config_space: dict[str, list],
    n_seeds: int,
) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """Grid search over hyperparameters."""
    
def analyze_convergence(
    results: pd.DataFrame,
) -> dict[str, float]:
    """Compute convergence metrics (M1-M3)."""
```

**Grid Search Space**:
```python
config_space = {
    "learning_rate": [0.01, 0.05, 0.1],
    "arousal_sensitivity": [0.1, 0.5, 1.0],
    "discount_factor": [0.9, 0.95, 0.99],
}
# 27 configurations total
```

#### 4. Metric Collection (1 hour)
**File**: `src/utils/metrics.py`

**Purpose**: Standardized measurement across all architectures

**Key Metrics**:
```python
def compute_convergence_speed(
    rewards_per_episode: list[float],
    window: int = 50,
) -> int | None:
    """M1: Episodes to 95% of max performance."""
    
def compute_sample_efficiency(
    episode_lengths: list[int],
    convergence_episode: int,
) -> int:
    """M2: Total steps to convergence."""
    
def compute_final_performance(
    rewards: list[float],
    n_episodes: int = 100,
) -> float:
    """M3: Mean reward over last 100 episodes."""
```

- [ ] Generate baseline visualizations
- [ ] Document baseline performance

---

## Success Criteria Reminder

### Phase 1 Baseline Success (Must Achieve)
- ✅ Agent converges reliably (<200 episodes)
- ✅ Low variance across seeds (CV < 0.3)
- ✅ Reaches goal consistently (>90% success rate)
- ✅ Arousal mechanism demonstrably active (arousal varies with errors)

### Phase 1 Baseline Failure (Abort if True)
- ❌ No convergence in 500 episodes
- ❌ High variance (CV > 0.5)
- ❌ Success rate < 70%
- ❌ Arousal stuck at extremes (0 or 1 always)

---

## Resource Estimates (Updated)

### Computational Requirements
- Training per seed: ~5-10 minutes (estimated)
- Hyperparameter search: 27 configs × 20 seeds = 540 runs
- Sequential time: 45-90 hours
- **Parallel time (4 cores)**: 12-24 hours
- **Parallel time (8 cores)**: 6-12 hours

### Hardware Available
- RTX 3060 12GB (not needed for Q-learning, will be critical for Tier 2 DQN)
- 64GB RAM (excellent for parallel training)
- Pop!_OS Linux (stable, good for long runs)

**Recommendation**: Implement multiprocessing in training script from start

## Implementation Philosophy (Validated)

The environment validation confirms our methodological approach:

1. ✅ **Empirical Rigor**: Every claim testable (domain separability verified)
2. ✅ **Conceptual Clarity**: Theoretical foundations mapped correctly to implementation
3. ✅ **Methodological Transparency**: All design decisions documented
4. ✅ **Conservative Validation**: Verify assumptions before building (just did this!)
5. ✅ **Falsifiability**: Clear criteria for rejecting hypothesis (defined for Phase 1)

   ↓
   Environment Validated
   ↓
→ Phase 1 (Next: 5 days)
   ↓
   Decision Point 1: Does baseline converge?
   ├─ YES → Continue to Phase 2
   └─ NO → Debug environment/agent, iterate
      ↓
→ Phase 2 (Week 2)
   ↓
   Decision Point 2: Does modularity help?
   ├─ YES → Continue to Phase 3
   └─ NO → Understand why, iterate
      ↓
→ Phase 3 (Week 2-3)
   ↓
   Decision Point 3: Does arousal integration win?
   ├─ YES → Proceed to Tier 2
   └─ NO → Analyze ablations, understand failure
      ↓
→ Phase 4 (Week 3)
   ↓
   Final Decision: Tier 1 Pass/Fail
```

**Current Position**: ✅ Phase 0 → Phase 1

## Questions for Ty

1. **Parallelization**: Should we implement multiprocessing from start (recommended) or run sequentially?

2. **Progress Tracking**: Real-time plots during training or post-hoc analysis only?

3. **Checkpointing**: Save all intermediate Q-tables or just final convergence metrics?

4. **Debug Mode**: Verbose logging for first few runs to verify correctness?

5. **Hardware**: Any concerns about running 12+ hour training jobs? (Can split into smaller batches if needed)

---

## Confidence Assessment

**Phase 0 Success**: 100% (tests passed)
**Phase 1 Success**: 85% (Q-learning on this environment should converge)
**Phase 2 Success**: 70% (modularity might not help)
**Phase 3 Success**: 60% (arousal integration is the big test)
**Tier 1 Overall**: 50% (compound probabilities, realistic assessment)

**This is appropriate uncertainty for frontier research.** If confidence were higher, it wouldn't be novel. If lower, it wouldn't be worth pursuing.
