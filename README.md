# Arousal Integration Validation - Tier 1

**Status**: ✅ Phase 0 Complete - Environment Validated
**Next**: Phase 1 - Baseline Agent Implementation
**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks to Tier 1 decision

---

## Project Overview

This project tests whether **arousal-weighted integration of domain-specific modules** outperforms monolithic architectures in reinforcement learning. The work synthesizes three neuroscientific frameworks:

1. **DMN Modularity** (Yazin et al., 2025) - Brain fragments experience into State/Agent/Action domains
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-63522-y

2. **PVT Arousal Modulation** (me, 2025) - Arousal modulates learning based on prediction errors
https://github.com/angrysky56/pvt-inspired-ai

3. **Temporal Coding Theory** (Baker & Cariani, 2025) - [Future work: temporal binding mechanisms]
https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/computational-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fncom.2025.1540532/full

### Central Hypothesis

**H₁**: Arousal-weighted integration of specialized modules enables faster convergence and better adaptation than monolithic systems by dynamically allocating cognitive resources to domain-specific prediction errors.

### Why This Matters

Current AI uses monolithic "do-everything" networks. Brains use specialized regions coordinated by arousal/emotion. We're testing whether AI should work more like brains.

## Architecture Overview

### SimpleSocialGridWorld

**Environment Design**:
- 5×5 grid with NPC at center (2,2)
- Goal at opposite corner (4,4)
- NPC mood: {Friendly, Neutral, Hostile}
- Mood changes every 75 episodes

**Domain Structure**:
- **State Domain**: Navigation, spatial reasoning
- **Agent Domain**: Social assessment, theory of mind (simplified)

**Reward Structure**:
```
Goal reached:       +10.0  (primary objective)
Step cost:          -0.1   (efficiency incentive)
Hostile interaction: -5.0   (major penalty)
Friendly interaction: +1.0   (minor bonus)
Wall collision:      -1.0   (navigation error)
```

### Three Architectures

**Architecture A: Monolithic PVT (Baseline)**
- Single Q-table for combined state
- Global arousal modulation
- Tests: Does PVT arousal help at all?

**Architecture B: Separate-Manual (Control)**
- Two independent Q-tables (State + Agent)
- Fixed integration rule (no arousal)
- Tests: Does modularity alone help?

**Architecture C: Integrated-Arousal (Experimental)**
- Two independent Q-tables
- Arousal-weighted integration
- Tests: Does arousal integration win?

### Arousal Computation

```python
arousal = base × surprise_boost × salience_boost × stress_penalty

where:
  surprise_boost = 1 + (|prediction_error| × sensitivity)
  salience_boost = 1 + (|reward| × sensitivity)
  stress_penalty = 1 / (1 + excess²)  # Inverted-U
```

**Integration Strategies**:
1. **Weighted**: `weights = softmax([arousal_state, arousal_agent])`
2. **Gated**: Winner-take-all with threshold fallback

## Key Metrics

**M1: Convergence Speed**
Episodes to reach 95% of max performance

**M2: Sample Efficiency**
Total steps to convergence

**M3: Final Performance**
Mean reward over last 100 episodes

### Secondary Metrics (Mechanism Validation)

## Philosophical Implications

### If H₁ is Confirmed (Arousal Integration Works)

**Epistemological**: Validates brain-inspired modularity as more than evolutionary constraint

**Architectural**: Suggests fundamental limits of monolithic scaling

**Practical**: Opens path to more efficient AI through domain-appropriate inductive biases

### If H₀ is Confirmed (Integration Doesn't Help)

**Epistemological**: Brain's solution may not be optimal for digital systems

**Architectural**: Integration overhead exceeds specialization gains

**Practical**: Continue scaling monolithic architectures

### The Deeper Question

**Are we engineering cognition or discovering it?** If arousal-weighted integration works, it suggests cognitive architecture has discoverable principles, not just emergent properties.
