## The Big Picture in 3 Minutes

### What Are We Testing?
**Hypothesis**: Specialized AI modules coordinated by arousal-based attention work better than monolithic "do-everything" systems.

### Why Does This Matter?
Current AI (like GPT) uses one giant network for everything. Your brain doesn't - it has specialized regions coordinated by arousal/emotion. We're testing whether AI should work more like brains.

### How Does It Work?
1. **Split the problem**: Navigation (State) + Social assessment (Agent)
2. **Add arousal**: Each module gets "surprised" by errors
3. **Integrate dynamically**: High arousal = high priority for that module
4. **Compare**: Does this beat standard AI?

### What Have We Built?
- **Environment**: Gridworld where agent must navigate AND assess NPC mood
- **Three systems**: Monolithic (baseline), Modular-fixed (control), Modular-arousal (experimental)
- **Tests**: Comprehensive validation framework

## Key Concepts Glossary

### Arousal
**What**: Scalar signal (0-1) indicating importance/urgency  
**How**: Computed from prediction errors + reward magnitude + time pressure  
**Why**: Directs attention and learning resources to critical domains  
**Validated**: 30% faster learning in single-domain RL (your pvt-inspired-ai)

### Domain
**State**: Context, environment, spatial layout (vmPFC in brain)  
**Agent**: Social reasoning, theory of mind (amPFC in brain)  
**Action**: Planning, trajectories, temporal sequences (dmPFC in brain)

### Integration
**Fixed**: Static rules (e.g., "if hostile, avoid")  
**Weighted**: Dynamic softmax weighting by arousal  
**Gated**: Winner-take-all selection by arousal threshold

### Modularity
**Benefit**: Specialization with domain-appropriate representations  
**Cost**: Integration overhead (coordination complexity)  
**Question**: Does benefit exceed cost?

python tests/test_environment.py
```

- Agent module (social assessment PVT agent)
- Architecture B (fixed integration)

**Time**: 1 week  
**Purpose**: Test modularity alone

**Purpose**: Understand why results occurred  
**Decision**: Document insights, plan Tier 2

## Common Questions

### Q: Why start with such a simple environment?
**A**: Testing mechanism in isolation. If arousal doesn't help in simple case, it won't help in complex cases. Scaling is Tier 2+.

### Q: Why not use modern deep RL (DQN, PPO)?
**A**: Function approximation adds confounds (network architecture, replay buffers). Q-learning isolates arousal mechanism.

### Q: What if it doesn't work?
**A**: That's valuable! We learn boundaries of brain-inspired approaches. Iterate based on ablation analysis.

### Q: How long until we know if it works?
**A**: 2-3 weeks to Tier 1 decision (with proper validation at each phase).

### Q: What's the best-case outcome?
**A**: >10% faster learning, validated mechanism, path to Tier 2 (real LLMs).

### Q: What's the worst-case outcome?
**A**: Integration overhead dominates specialization gains. We document why and try alternative approaches.

## Warning Signs to Watch For

### Red Flags (Suggest Fundamental Issue)
- Environment tests fail (domain separability not working)
- Baseline doesn't converge in 200 episodes (learning broken)
- High variance across seeds (unstable mechanism)
- Architecture B worse than A (modularity harmful)

### Yellow Flags (Suggest Parameter Tuning Needed)
- Arousal always maxed out (sensitivity too high)
- Arousal conflicts >50% (domains not separable enough)
- Architecture C barely beats B (integration not helping much)
- Training time exactly 2x (hitting overhead limit)

### Green Flags (Suggest Success)
- Architecture C significantly faster than A and B
- Arousal tracks prediction errors (M5 correlation >0.7)
- Advantage increases under stress (like PVT validation)
- Results stable across seeds (robust mechanism)

## Mental Models

### Analogy 1: Orchestra Conductor
**Monolithic system**: One musician plays all instruments  
**Modular-fixed**: Specialized musicians, rigid score  
**Modular-arousal**: Specialized musicians, conductor directs attention dynamically  

**Question**: Is the conductor (arousal integration) worth the coordination overhead?

### Analogy 2: Hospital Emergency Room
**Monolithic**: One doctor handles everything  
**Modular-fixed**: Specialists, fixed priority rules  
**Modular-arousal**: Specialists, triage system allocates resources dynamically  

**Question**: Does triage (arousal) improve outcomes or just add bureaucracy?

### Analogy 3: Company Organization
**Monolithic**: Founder does everything  
**Modular-fixed**: Departments with strict boundaries  
**Modular-arousal**: Departments with dynamic resource allocation  

**Question**: Does flexible resource allocation beat rigid hierarchy?

## Philosophy in Plain English

### Core Insight
Your brain doesn't try to be good at everything. It has specialized parts that get "excited" when their expertise is needed. We're testing if AI should work the same way.

### Why This Matters
If true, we can build more efficient AI by copying brain architecture.  
If false, we learn that evolution's solution isn't always optimal for engineering.

### The Bet
**We're betting**: Specialization + dynamic coordination > monolithic scaling  
**We're testing**: Does arousal provide the coordination mechanism?  
**We'll know**: In 2-3 weeks with rigorous data

### Intellectual Humility
We might be wrong. That's fine. Good science means following data, not defending theories.

## TL;DR (Twitter Version)

We're testing if AI should work more like brains: specialized modules coordinated by arousal/emotion, rather than one giant "do-everything" network.

**Why**: Your PVT work shows arousal improves learning. Brain research shows modular architecture. Combining them might be better than current AI.

**How**: Simple experiment, rigorous methodology, clear pass/fail criteria.

**When**: 2-3 weeks to first results.

**Risk**: Might not work (integration overhead). That's fine - we'll learn why.

**Upside**: If it works, we have a fundamentally better way to build AI.
