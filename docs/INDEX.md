## Key Insights by Document

### QUICK_START.md
**Core Insight**: Brain uses specialized modules + arousal coordination. We're testing if AI should too.

**Practical Value**: Clear next actions, mental models, warning signs

**Best For**: Getting oriented quickly, understanding next steps

### OVERVIEW.md
**Core Insight**: Arousal solves the integration problem (how to coordinate specialized modules).

**Philosophical Value**: Implications if H‚ÇÅ true vs. H‚ÇÄ true

**Best For**: Understanding "why this matters"

### THEORETICAL_FOUNDATIONS.md
**Core Insight**: Three neuroscience frameworks converge on modular architecture + arousal integration.

**Intellectual Value**: Complete argument with epistemological assumptions, alternative perspectives, blind spots

**Best For**: Comprehensive understanding, academic rigor, identifying research gaps

### ARCHITECTURAL_RATIONALE.md
**Core Insight**: Every design choice has explicit rationale grounded in theory or methodology.

**Practical Value**: Understand trade-offs, anticipate criticisms, justify decisions

**Best For**: Defending design decisions, planning modifications

## Documentation Philosophy

### Guiding Principles

1. **Conceptual Clarity**: Every term defined, every claim justified
2. **Methodological Transparency**: All design decisions documented with rationale
3. **Intellectual Honesty**: Limitations acknowledged, alternatives considered
4. **Practical Utility**: Not just theory - actionable next steps
5. **Conservative Empiricism**: Test simple case rigorously before scaling

### Structure Pattern (Applied Consistently)

Each document follows philosophical argument evaluation framework:
1. Conceptual Framework Deconstruction
2. Methodological Critique
3. Critical Perspective Integration
4. Argumentative Integrity Analysis
5. Contextual/Interpretative Nuances
6. Synthetic Evaluation

## Document Maintenance

### When to Update

**QUICK_START.md**: When next steps change (after each phase)  
**OVERVIEW.md**: When hypothesis evolves (after major findings)  
**THEORETICAL_FOUNDATIONS.md**: When new research emerges  
**ARCHITECTURAL_RATIONALE.md**: When design decisions change  
**STATUS.md**: After each implementation milestone  
**This Index**: When new docs added  

### Version Control
All documents in git. Commit messages should reference:
- What changed
- Why it changed
- What this means for the project
